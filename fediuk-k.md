N/A, Independent researcher

### Affiliations

ɬaʔamɩn (Tla’amin) Nation

### Core work interests related to Solving FCB
Providing support to First Nations on their food system and well-being research priorities has been an anchor of my work over the past two decades after completing training as a dietitian and nutrition researcher. Grounded in a rights-based approach, I help assess the impacts from changes to traditional food/lifeways and develop preferred food models and success criteria for Nation well-being, in an environment that has heavily changed in the last 150 years. For the past 15 years, I have had the privilege of working with Tla’amin Nation on harvest, nutrition and food security studies.
