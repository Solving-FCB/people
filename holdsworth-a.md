### Bio
Amber Holdsworth is a physical scientist at Fisheries and Oceans Canada. Her research focuses on ocean dynamics, turbulent boundary layers, and climate-scale modelling. She integrates biogeochemical and sea ice components into high-resolution simulations to project environmental change in Arctic and Pacific systems. She previously held research roles at the University of Victoria and University of Alberta, and founded the Community Climate Science Seminars in Victoria.
