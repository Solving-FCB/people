### Bio

Dr. Laura Bianucci is a marine biogeochemical modeller with a background in physical oceanography. She works with coupled physical–ecosystem models to explore the cycling of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen in the ocean and assess how marine ecosystems respond to climate change. Her research has addressed topics such as upwelling-driven deoxygenation, ocean acidification, and the effects of melting Greenland ice on the biogeochemistry of Atlantic Canada. She is currently involved with the Ocean Tracking Network, modeling species migration and biogeochemical vulnerability of the Canadian Atlantic shelf.

### Core work interests related to Solving FCB

Coastal ocean modelling applied to climate change and aquaculture questions  
Numerical modeling of coupled physical–biogeochemical ocean processes

### Topics of interest

Coastal oxygen cycle and deoxygenation
