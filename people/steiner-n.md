### Bio

Dr. Nadja Steiner is a research scientist at Fisheries and Oceans Canada specializing in modeling Arctic and North Pacific marine ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles. Her work focuses on the impacts of climate change, including sea-ice change, acidification, and the marine sulfur cycle. She collaborates on Earth system modeling and leads assessments for Arctic adaptation under national and international programs. Originally from Germany, she holds a PhD in sea ice modeling and has been a leading voice in Arctic system science since joining IOS in 2000.
