### Institution

University of Costa Rica

### Affiliations

Department of Geography – Water and Global Change Observatory, University of Costa Rica

### Bio

Dr. Christian Birkel is a Professor and Researcher specializing in hydrology. His work focuses on measuring and modeling runoff generation and the storage of water and biogeochemical substances. He aims to understand dynamic catchment systems to support scientifically informed decision-making. His research applies to streamflow generation, tracer techniques, rainfall-runoff modeling, and the effects of environmental change—particularly in tropical regions—on hydrology and water resources.

### Core work interests related to Solving FCB

Catchment hydrology; streamflow generation and biogeochemical modeling; sustainable management of surface waters; hydrological behavior in tropical regions

### Topics of interest

Tracer techniques for dynamic catchment behavior  
Rainfall-runoff and solute coupling models  
Environmental change impacts on tropical hydrology  
Statistical modeling of environmental time series

### Role in Solving FCB

Contributes hydrological modeling expertise and tropical systems analysis relevant to climate and ecosystem dynamics
